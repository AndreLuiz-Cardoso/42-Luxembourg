## 🔄 Structure by Learning Circles

Learning at 42 Luxembourg is divided into **learning circles (orbits)**. Each orbit consists of projects that progressively increase in complexity and scope. Below is the personal progression path:

### 🏊 Orbit 0: The Piscine
- 📌 **Overview:** A 4-week intensive selection program.
- 🎯 **Goal:** Assess adaptability, resilience, and teamwork under pressure.
- 🧪 **Challenges:**
  - Introduction to the C programming language.
  - Logic and algorithms fundamentals.
  - Daily deadlines and peer evaluations.

### 💡 Orbit 1: Fundamentals
- 🧱 **Libft:** Build a personal C library by reimplementing standard functions.

### 🧠 Orbit 2: I/O & Formatted Output
- 📖 **Get Next Line:** Read files line by line with buffer management.
- 🖨️ **Printf:** Recreate the printf function with all major format specifiers.
- 🔐 **Born2beroot:** Introduction to system administration and security. Learn to set up and harden a Linux-based virtual machine using LVM, configure UFW, SSH, password policies, and essential system services.

### 🎯 Orbit 3: Data Transfer & Algorithmic Thinking
- 📨 **Minitalk:** Implement message passing between processes using signals.
- ⛰️ **So Long:** Develop a 2D game using a simple graphics library (MiniLibX).
- 🔢 **Push Swap:** Create an efficient algorithm to sort data using stacks and limited operations.

### ⚙️ Orbit 4: Process Management & Concurrency
- 🍝 **Philosophers:** Solve the dining philosophers problem using threads and mutexes.
- 🐚 **Minishell:** Build a fully functional Unix shell with support for pipes, redirections, signals, and built-in commands.

### 🧬 Orbit 5: Networking, Graphics & OOP

- 🌐 **NetPractice:** Interactive project to deepen your understanding of computer networking. Simulate and debug real-world network setups by working with IP addressing, routing, and subnetting.
- 🕹️ **Cub3D:** Create a basic 3D game using raycasting techniques in C. Develop your own game engine with texture mapping, player movement, collision detection, and real-time rendering using MiniLibX.
- 🧠 **CPP Modules:** Comprehensive introduction to C++ and Object-Oriented Programming. Master key concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, operator overloading, and modular design.
